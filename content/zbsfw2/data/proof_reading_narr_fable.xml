  <text><![CDATA[<p align="center"><b>The Dog and the Bone</b></p>	Once there was {+|a} dog that found a wonderful bone. He carried it around in {-|in} his mouth. From time to time, he would sit down and chew on the bone. 
	As the dog walked along, he came to a bridge. {u}below the bridge was a pond. The water was so still that it was like a mirror. When the dog looked down, he saw another dog, and the other dog also had a bone. “I’ll get his bone, and then I’ll have two,” said the dog{.}
	The dog bent over and opened his mouth to get the other bone. Too late, he saw his own bone splash into the water{.} Now he had no bone, {l}But he was a smarter dog.]]></text>
