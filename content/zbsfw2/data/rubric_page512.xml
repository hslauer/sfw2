<table>
  <tr> <!--Ideas-->
    <td>The topic is just the right size—not too big or too small. Descriptive details introduce and develop the setting, narrator, characters, and plot. Carefully selected ideas completely satisfy the needs of the reader.</td>
    <td>The topic is the right size. Details introduce and develop the setting, narrator, characters, and plot. The ideas selected by the author frequently meet the needs of the reader.</td>
    <td>The topic is too big or too small. Some details develop the setting, narrator, characters, and plot. The ideas selected by the author sometimes meet the needs of the reader.</td>
    <td>The writing is not a narrative. Details are unrelated or not included.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> <!--Organization-->
    <td>The narrative unfolds logically and naturally. Transition words and phrases help sequence the events. A strong beginning leads to a satisfying conclusion.</td>
    <td>Some events are not connected or are out of order. Transition words and phrases are needed to help sequence the events. The beginning and the conclusion work, but may not be strong.</td>
    <td>The narrative does not unfold logically and naturally. Events are out of order. Transition words and phrases are confusing or missing. The beginning or the conclusion is weak.</td>
    <td>The writing is disorganized and very difficult to follow. Transition words and phrases are not used. No beginning or conclusion is evident.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> <!--Voice-->
    <td>The voice, mood, and tone are just right for the purpose. Dialogue, if used, reveals each character’s voice clearly.</td>
    <td>The voice, mood, and tone are just right in places, but inconsistent. Dialogue, if used, somewhat reveals the characters’ voices.</td>
    <td>The voice sounds disinterested. Mood and tone are weak. Dialogue, if used, does not uniquely distinguish the characters’ voices.</td>
    <td>Voice is flat. Mood and tone are absent. Dialogue, if used, does not sound right for some of the characters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> <!--Word Choice-->
    <td>Words and phrases consistently help the reader “see” the characters and “experience” the events. Nouns and verbs are clear and precise, supported by a few carefully selected modifiers.</td>
    <td>Some words and phrases help the reader picture characters and events, but some are too general. Certain nouns and verbs are weak, requiring too much help from modifiers. Modifiers are satisfactory.</td>
    <td>Many words and phrases are too general. They keep the reader from picturing the characters and events clearly. Nouns and verbs lack clarity or precision. Too many or too few modifiers are used, and many of them are weak.</td>
    <td>Many words are not used correctly. They distract the reader.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> <!--Sentence Fluency-->
    <td>Varied sentence beginnings, lengths, and patterns make the writing flow smoothly. Several particularly well-crafted sentences add style and interest. The paper is effortlessly read aloud with inflection or feeling.</td>
    <td>There is some variation in sentence beginnings, lengths, and patterns. The sentences are correct, and one or two sentences add style. The paper can be read aloud with inflection or feeling.</td>
    <td>Many sentences have the same beginnings, lengths, and patterns. This interrupts the flow of the writing. The sentences are mostly correct but ordinary. It is difficult to read the paper with inflection.</td>
    <td>Sentences are poorly written or incorrect. The writing does not flow.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> <!--Conventions-->
    <td>Spelling, grammar, punctuation, and capitalization are correct. The narrative contains no errors.</td>
    <td>There are a few grammatical errors that may cause the reader to pause momentarily, but meaning is clear.</td>
    <td>Many errors are present, and some confuse the reader.</td>
    <td>The writing has not been edited. Serious errors make the narrative hard to understand.</td>
