  <text><![CDATA[<p align="center"><b>Swimming Lessons</b></p>	My grandma said that if I want to go to the pool, I have to learn to swim. So, I signed up for lessons. I am in the beginner’s class. I go on Monday and {u}wednesday mornings. Last week we learned how to float. It {+|is} fun to rest on the water and look at the sky. You have to be careful not to wiggle. 
	{u}yesterday we learned to tread water. You don’t go anywhere. You just keep your head above water. Tomorrow I will learn my first swimming stroke. It is called the crawl{.}
	After my swimming lessons, I get to stay at the pool until {l}Lunch. I can practice my swimming. I can also play with my friends in the {-|the} shallow water. ]]></text>
