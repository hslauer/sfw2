Dear Alyssa,
	Mom told me you are going to stay with us for a week this summer. Be sure to bring your {l}Bike so we can ride to the park on Main Street. There is a new pool at the park, so we can go swimming.
	Our last day of school was Friday{.} I will be in third grade next fall, and I hope I get {u}ms. Santoz for my teacher. In third grade we get to take {+|a} field trip to the state capital. That will be a lot of fun{.}
	Iâ€™m marking off the days on the {-|the} calendar until you get here!
				Your cousin,
				Kayla]]></text>
