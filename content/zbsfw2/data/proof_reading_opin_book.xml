  <text><![CDATA[<p align="center"><b><i>Ox-Cart Man</i></b></p>	<i>Ox-Cart Man</i> by Donald Hall is a book you should read. It tells how people used {+|to} make money{.} They did not have jobs like people today. They had to make things to sell.
	Everyone in the family made things. The father made a cart. {u}the mother made yarn and linen. The daughter knitted mittens. The son carved brooms. They made many other things, too. 
	In the fall, the father loaded the cart. He took the things they had made to {l}Town. He sold everything. Then he bought things the family needed. He even brought them some candy for {-|four} a special treat.
	I really liked this book{.} I learned a lot from it, and I think you will, too.]]></text>
