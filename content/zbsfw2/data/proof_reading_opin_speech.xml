  <text><![CDATA[<p align="center"><b>Year-Round School</b></p>	Some people think we should have school all year long. I think that is {+|a} bad idea. Students need breaks. They need time to play and relax{.} Then they will study harder during school days.
	My favorite time of the year is the summer. For over two months, I can swim and play with my friends. That doesnâ€™t mean {u}i stop learning. I go to the {-|the} library and get books to read. I watch good television shows. I learn to play new games at the {l}Park. I explore the woods. I learn new skills with my scout troop.
	Remember how much you liked summer when you were a kid? Please vote "no" on year-round schools{.} I thank you for your help. ]]></text>
